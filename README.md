# Computational Thinking using Python

In this repository, you are going to find the PSETS for both MIT courses (6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python & 6.00.2x: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science) related to the program Computational Thinking using Python

There are some comments made by me while coding that help me out as a hint in some problems.

I know there are optimal ways of doing some of the algorithms related to some problems, maybe what data structure was selected or how to avoid many if-else clauses. 

Hope it can be useful to someone who takes the course.
